    <h1>The Space Station</h1>
    <p>
        The Space Station is an independent project created to educate visitors about the universe and space. Space is filled with fascinating objects, each telling a story of the universe's vastness. Stars, like our Sun, are giant nuclear reactors powering entire solar systems. Planets orbit stars, with some, like Earth, supporting life. Moons accompany planets, shaping tides and landscapes. Asteroids and comets are ancient space debris, remnants from the solar system's formation.
